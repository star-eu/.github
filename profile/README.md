# STAR - EU Horizon 2020 
**STAR** is a joint effort of 15 European partners towards designing new technologies to enable the deployment of standard-based secure, safe, reliable and trusted human centric AI systems in manufacturing environment. STAR aims to research, develop, validate and make available to the community leading-edge AI technologies including explainable AI, active learning systems, simulated reality systems, human-centric digital twins, advanced reinforcement learning techniques and cyber-defense mechanisms, thus becoming a catalyst for the deployment of advanced AI systems in the manufacturing shop-floor.

Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly improving the automation of production in the manufacturing sector. But in order for these systems to be trusted and applicable when replacing human tasks in dynamic operation, they need to be safe and adjustable â€“ to react to different situations, security threats, unpredictable events or specific environments. STAR will rise to this challenge by designing new technologies to enable the implementation of standard-based, secure, safe, reliable and trusted human-centric AI systems in manufacturing environments. The project will aim to research and integrate leading-edge AI technologies like active learning systems, simulated reality systems, explainable AI, human-centric digital twins, advanced reinforcement learning techniques and cyber-defence mechanisms, to allow the safe deployment of sophisticated AI systems in production lines.
